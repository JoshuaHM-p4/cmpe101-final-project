                      CMPE 102 Programming Logic and Design
                                 GROUP FINAL Project

   Programmed By:
        Joshua Mistal
        Ralph Daniel Jimenez
        Miel Gagolinan
        Jo Mari Raphael Mangahas
        Mark Brin
   Course and Section: BSCpE 1-3
   Instructor: Prof. Engr. Julius S. Cansino
    Class Schedule: Saturday 2:00 PM - 8:00PM
   Date Performed: January
   Date Submitted: January, 2024

NOTE TO PROGRAMMERS:
1. Consider using a class to encapsulate the address book functionality. âœ”
    This can help with organization and make it easier to manage the state of the address book.

2.  Add comments to your code to explain the purpose of functions and any complex logic.
3.  Validate user inputs to handle potential errors (e.g., non-integer inputs, invalid options).
4. Use meaningful variable and function names to improve code readability.
5. Consider adding error handling to handle unexpected issues gracefully.
